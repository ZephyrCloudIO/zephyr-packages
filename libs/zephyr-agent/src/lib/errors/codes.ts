- The remote application '{{ appName }}' has not been built with Zephyr yet
- The specified version '{{ version }}' does not exist
- You don't have access to this application
- The application exists but no environment has been created

Steps to resolve:
1. Ensure the remote application is built with Zephyr first
2. For newly created applications, create an environment:
   - Go to https://app.zephyr-cloud.io
   - Navigate to your application
   - Create a new environment (e.g., "development" or "production")
3. Check that the version exists by visiting the dashboard
4. Verify you have access to {{ orgName }}/{{ projectName }}/{{ appName }}
5. If you need any version, use "*" as the version in zephyr:dependencies

Expected behavior:
- Remote applications must be built and deployed before they can be consumed
- Applications must have at least one environment created
- Version must match an existing build (use "*" for latest)
- When using "*", at least one version must exist in the application
- You must have read access to the remote application

Failed to resolve remote application with version {{ version }}

This could be due to one of the following reasons:

- Zephyr API is temporarily unavailable
- Application naming mismatch in configuration

Steps to resolve:
1. Check your network connection
2. If using "*" version, ensure at least one version exists
3. Ensure the application has an environment created in the dashboard

Expected behavior:
- Remote application must have at least one deployed version
- Application must have at least one environment

Application naming is based on:
- git organization/username
- git repository name
- name in package.json

For debugging, check:
- Your ~/.zephyr folder for cached tokens
- Network proxy settings if behind corporate firewall
- API status at https://status.zephyr-cloud.io
